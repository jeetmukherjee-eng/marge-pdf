# marge-pdf
This is a small project or code which can be used for marging pdfs using python
 Some points to be remember:-
 1. You have installed latest version of Python
 2. You have installed the PyPDF2 tool kit
 3. Saved the PDF files that you want to merge in Pythonâ€™s working directory. Of course, you can change the directory using Python code. For simplicity of code, I am placing the PDF files on the working directory for these two methods that I am going to present here
 4. Name the file as - 1.pdf,2.pdf and so on.
